Description of file "piscine.h":

In the winter of 2018 I passed the selection to school 42.
All functions described in header are a task from the pool 42.
It describes the functions of standard C programming language libraries.

Conclusion:

These tasks helped me get the first C language experience, data types,
variables, pointers, algorithms for searching and sorting, Git,
and most importantly - teamwork and self-learning.
